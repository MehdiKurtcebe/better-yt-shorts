# Leaving so soon?

We're sad to see you go! It would be great if you could let us know why you're uninstalling the extension by leaving feedback below.

### Notice: Chrome Web Store Takedown

We have reuploaded the extension under a [new link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-youtube-shorts/pehohlhkhbcfdneocgnfbnilppmfncdg) as the previous one was taken down due to trademark issue. The original extension had a total of 25K installs, 16K active users and 4.59â˜… rating. We hope the original link will be restored soon, if possible. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
